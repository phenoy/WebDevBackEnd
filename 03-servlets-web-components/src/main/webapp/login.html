<!-- Inspect, After entering username password, and clicking Login button
Navigate to Payload -> view source, information present there is called the query string.
"?USER_NAME=ds&Password=gfdgf#" becomes part of the URL because the <form method="get"...> 
Whereas if form method is changed to post, the query string won't be part of the URL anymore
SHA256 algorithm can be used to mask the password, even when we INSPECT the code of the page -->
